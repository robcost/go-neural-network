This repo contains some basic ML constructs in golang. This is a learning repo, definitely not for use in a real application. 

## 1 - Basic
Single node network showing predictions with weights.

## 2 - MultiInput


## 3 - MultiOutput


## 4 - MultiInputOutput


## 5 - HoldColdLearning
Simple loop demonstrating stepping up/down towards a an optimal weight.

## 6 - Derivative
Find a derivative (weight delta) that represents the signal we should follow, sending the weights up/down and by how much in subsequent itereations.

## 7 - Back Propatation
Implement loop to carry weight updates back through network. It seems that gonum precision is higher than numpy, meaning it takes longer for the layer 2 error to converge, meaning more iterations required for same result.


## 8 -
